You can move and resize windows on your screen in any direction you like by clicking at any point within the window and dragging. Try it out and you'll never look back.

This animated GIF doesn't capture the mouse cursor correctly; in real life the cursor moves along with moving and resizing the window as expected. Nevertheless, the animation still shows what you can do with this tool.

## Installation

This tool requires [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) to be installed and running.

To install SkyRocket.spoon, after downloading and unzipping, move the folder to ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons and make sure the name of the folder is 'SkyRocket.spoon'. 

Alternatively, you can simply run the following command from the Terminal:

```lua

mkdir -p ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons && git clone https://github.com/franzbu/SkyRocket.spoon.git ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/SkyRocket.spoon

```

## Usage

Once you've installed it, add this to your `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua` file:

```lua
local SkyRocket = hs.loadSpoon("SkyRocket")

SkyRocket:new({
  -- Opacity of resize canvas
  opacity = 0.3,

  -- Which modifiers to hold to move a window?
  moveModifiers = {'cmd', 'shift'},

  -- Which mouse button to hold to move a window?
  moveMouseButton = 'left',

  -- Which modifiers to hold to resize a window?
  resizeModifiers = {'ctrl', 'shift'},

  -- Which mouse button to hold to resize a window?
  resizeMouseButton = 'left',
})
```
I can recommend using CapsLock as hyper key (with Karabiner Elements, CapsLock can be reconfigured that if pressed alone it acts as CapsLock and if used in combination with another key or a mouse button it acts as modifier key). I have set Hammerspoon up to move a window using CapsLock in combination with the left mouse button and to resize a window using CapsLock in combination with the right mouse button.

In case of using CapsLock as hyper key, add the following lines to your `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua` file:

```lua
local SkyRocket = hs.loadSpoon("SkyRocket")

sky = SkyRocket:new({
  -- Opacity of resize canvas
  opacity = 0.3,

  -- Which modifiers to hold to move a window?
  moveModifiers = {'shift', 'ctrl', 'alt', 'cmd'},

  -- Which mouse button to hold to move a window?
  moveMouseButton = 'left',

  -- Which modifiers to hold to resize a window?
  resizeModifiers = {'shift', 'ctrl', 'alt', 'cmd'},

  -- Which mouse button to hold to resize a window?
  resizeMouseButton = 'right',
})
```


### Moving

To move a window, hold your `moveModifiers` down, then click `moveMouseButton` and drag a window.

### Resizing

To resize a window, hold your `resizeModifiers` down, then click `resizeMouseButton` and drag a window.

### Disabling move/resize for apps

You can disable move/resize for any app by adding it to the `disabledApps` option:

```lua
sky = SkyRocket:new({
  -- For example, if you run your terminal in full-screen mode you might not
  -- to accidentally resize it:
  disabledApps = {"Alacritty"},
})
```

## Thanks

There is a variety of tools to resize (and move) windows on macOS using the mouse and a modifier key. None have satisfied me, be it for the lack of fluency or functional limitations. The tool SkyRocket (v1.0.2) by dbalatero, who ingeniously uses a transparent canvas for addressing the already mentioned lack of fluency of other tools, came close to what I wanted, as for me dbalatero's tool only lacked to ability to resize windows all four directions. Therefore, I have extended his tool with the functionality to achieve exactly that. Huge thanks to dbalatero for laying the groundwork.
