# 🌄 🚀 SkyRocket.spoon


Starting with version 1.0.3, windows can be resized all four directions.

This Hammerspoon Spoon lets you **resize** and **move** windows by clicking + dragging them while holding down modifier keys.

## Installation

This tool requires [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) to be installed and running.

To install SkyRocket.spoon, after downloading and unzipping, move the folder to ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons and make sure the name of the folder is 'SkyRocket.spoon'. 

Alternatively, you can simply run the following command from the Terminal:

```lua

mkdir -p ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons && git clone https://github.com/franzbu/SkyRocket.spoon.git ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/SkyRocket.spoon

```

## Usage

Once you've installed it, add this to your `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua` file:

```lua
local SkyRocket = hs.loadSpoon("SkyRocket")

sky = SkyRocket:new({
  -- Opacity of resize canvas
  opacity = 0.3,

  -- Which modifiers to hold to move a window?
  moveModifiers = {'cmd', 'shift'},

  -- Which mouse button to hold to move a window?
  moveMouseButton = 'left',

  -- Which modifiers to hold to resize a window?
  resizeModifiers = {'ctrl', 'shift'},

  -- Which mouse button to hold to resize a window?
  resizeMouseButton = 'left',
})
```

### Moving

To move a window, hold your `moveModifiers` down, then click `moveMouseButton` and drag a window.

### Resizing

To resize a window, hold your `resizeModifiers` down, then click `resizeMouseButton` and drag a window.

### Disabling move/resize for apps

You can disable move/resize for any app by adding it to the `disabledApps` option:

```lua
sky = SkyRocket:new({
  -- For example, if you run your terminal in full-screen mode you might not
  -- to accidentally resize it:
  disabledApps = {"Alacritty"},
})
```

## Thanks

There is a variety of tools to resize (and move) windows on macOS using the mouse and a modifier key. None have satisfied me, be it for the lack of fluency or functional limitations. The tool SkyRocket (v1.0.2) by dbalatero, who ingeniously uses a transparent canvas for addressing the already mentioned lack of fluency of other tools, came close to what I wanted, as for me dbalatero's tool only lacked to ability to resize windows all four directions. Therefore, I have extended his tool with the functionality to achieve exactly that. Huge thanks to dbalatero for laying the groundwork.
